Analysis

1.) The weather has the highest max temperature for cities as they are located closer to latitude 0, the Equator. This makes sense as that is where sunlight hits the most directly, rather than at an angle such as with northern or southern cities. Also, during this time of year, it is much colder in the high latitudes of northern hemisphere cities, which makes sense due to the seasonal tilt of the Earth, and this corresponds to northern hemisphere winter.

2.) There is a cluster of cities with very low humidities (~20%) at around latitudes 20 and -20. These latitudes near the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn have very low moisture due to wind and ocean currents and feature the Sahara Desert as well as the Australian Outback.

3.) There doesn't seem to be any overall pattern to city latitudes and their wind speeds. There is a cluster of very high wind speed (25-30 mph) cities at a latitude of around 70 in the northern hemisphere. This corresponds to the most northern cities of Canada, Russia, Norway, and Alaska, which are mostly coastal to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, and thus exposed to very high wind speeds.
